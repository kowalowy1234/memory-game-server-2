# memory-game-server-2
Nestjs application made to handle web socket server-side operations for a second iteration of my memory game project.

This time I'm designing and creating this project with multiplayer functionality in mind. Also revamped UI and different tech stack.
The project has two different code bases. The one you are currently looking at is the server side of the project. [Here](https://github.com/kowalowy1234/memory-game-2) you can check the other part of it, the client.
